1. formatdata.py
• This processes the raw data and generates some data files required for the
project

2. resolve_data_conflicts.py
• This is used for resolving some data conflicts, and also for generating the
bigraph file (used in the next step for biclique detection)

3. Generate bicliques using the existing bi-clique detection algorithm as mentioned in
the paper
4. format_bicliques.py
• Using this code, the bicliques detected in the previous step can be further
customized/formatted for more granular analysis

5. scoring_bicliques.py
6. build_similarity_matrix.py
7. build_final_similarity_matrix.py
8. article_n2v_representations.py
